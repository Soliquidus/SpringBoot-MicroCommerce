## Spring Boot microService mini-project.

A little training project (very basic) I did with Maven in order to discover the fundamentals of Spring Boot.

* The API's functional tests were made with [Postman](https://web.postman.co/).
* To simulate the Database I used [H2](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-h2-database).
